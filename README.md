# Mastermind-Game
Welcome to the Mastermind Game, a code-breaking challenge where the player tries to guess a hidden code generated by the computer. This game is a single-player adaptation, perfect for sharpening strategic thinking!


# Game Rules
Objective: Guess the correct four-color code selected by the computer.

Code: The computer creates a random combination of four colors from the following list: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Yellow (Y), White (W), and Orange (O).

Turns: You have 10 attempts to guess the code.

Feedback: After each guess, you’ll receive feedback on:

Correct Position: The number of colors that are correct and in the correct position.

Incorrect Position: The number of correct colors that are in the wrong positions.

Winning: You win if you guess the code correctly within 10 tries. If not, you lose, and the game reveals the code.


# Code Structure and Function Usage
This game is modular, meaning each function handles a specific part of the game logic. By breaking down the program into functions, the code becomes easier to read, maintain, and debug.


# Why def is Used in This Program
In Python, def is used to define functions. Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. Using functions makes the code modular, reduces repetition, and allows each part of the game to operate independently. Here’s how each function is defined and why they’re essential for the game:

# 1. generate_code()
Definition: def generate_code():
Purpose: This function generates a random, four-color code from the predefined list of colors.
Why: Using def allows this code generation process to be encapsulated in its own function, making it easy to call whenever a new game starts. It keeps the main game logic separate and clean.
# 2. guess_code()
Definition: def guess_code():
Purpose: This function prompts the user to input a guess, checks if it’s valid, and returns the guess if it meets the criteria.
Why: Using a separate function for guessing allows us to keep input handling and validation in one place. If the player enters invalid input (e.g., not four colors, or colors outside the valid list), the function gives an error message and prompts them again. Defining this function separately makes it easy to manage all validation logic in one place.
# 3. check_code(guess, real_code)
Definition: def check_code(guess, real_code):
Purpose: Compares the user’s guess to the generated code, counting how many colors are in the correct position and how many are correct but in the wrong position.
Why: Having a comparison function makes it possible to focus solely on the logic of comparing the guess with the actual code. This separation ensures that the feedback calculation is reusable and allows adjustments if needed without affecting other parts of the program.
# 4. game()
Definition: def game():
Purpose: This is the main function that runs the game loop. It handles attempts, provides feedback, and checks for win/lose conditions.
Why: The game() function ties all the other functions together, making the game flow logically from one step to the next. By defining the main game loop separately, it’s easy to see the flow of the game and ensure that each function interacts correctly.


# Purpose of the Game
This game was created for my younger cousin, who often visits and needs an entertaining activity. This Python program provides them with a fun, strategic challenge to pass the time and develop problem-solving skills while trying to guess the hidden code.
